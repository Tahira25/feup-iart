## Parkinson's disease

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system.

Early in the course of the disease, the most obvious symptoms are movement-related; these include shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with walking and gait.

Later, thinking and behavioral problems may arise, with dementia commonly occurring in the advanced stages of the disease, whereas depression is the most common psychiatric symptom.


## Parkinson's disease diagnosis application

A data set with multiple types of sound recordings of Parkinson speech can be found at [UCI Machine Learning Repository][2].
